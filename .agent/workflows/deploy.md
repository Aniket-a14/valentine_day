# Deploying to Vercel

Since this is a Next.js application, Vercel is the easiest and most professional way to get it online.

### 1. Push to GitHub
Ensure all your changes are committed and pushed to a GitHub repository.

### 2. Connect to Vercel
- Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub.
- Click **"Add New"** > **"Project"**.
- Import your `valentine` repository.

### 3. Configure & Deploy
- Vercel will automatically detect **Next.js**.
- Click **"Deploy"**.
- Once finished, you will get a professional URL (e.g., `valentine-app.vercel.app`) to share with her! ❤️
